# ISZ-NEX-Dumps
## THE COMMUNITY NEEDS YOU!
**I know most of you don't care, don't have a Hacked 3DS, etc. However the Servers that keep Ice Station Z up are closing within the next __12 hours__!**
**And I need your help to preserve the game's online functionality, that made it unique, from Chatting, to raiding the Cave from Pocky.**
**Me and another individual as far as I know, are the only people attempting to make NEX Dumps, I have only 4 Dumps as of now (each about 24kb each).**
**And while we aren't the best community, or even a community now, we need your help!**

**1. If you have a jailbroken 3DS Console, and want to help, you need to Download this [HokakuCTR.3gx](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/HokakuCTR/releases/tag/v1.0.3) plugin from GitHub.**
**2. Make sure you have the latest Version of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases) with 3GX Plugin Loading.**
**3. Paste the contents of `Luma3DSv13.0.2.zip` onto the Root of the SDHC Card, and paste the `HokakuCTR.3gx` Plugin into the following directory below (Create directories as Needed).**
```
Directory:
.\luma\plugins\[TitleID]

If you bought the Game in Japan, your TitleID will be the one Labeled "JPN", etc.
USA - 0004000000190300
JPN - 00040000001BEA00
EUR - 0004000000199700

Example of what Full Path it will be in:
.\luma\plugins\0004000000199700\HokakuCTR.3gx
```
**4. Start up your console with the newly applied changes, and update to the newest Firmware if Prompted.**
**5. Open the Rosalina Menu `L + DPad-Down + Select`, and Press the `A` Button on the `Plugin Loader` Option. Make sure the text reads as follows: `Plugin Loader: [Enabled]`.**
**6. Startup "Ice Station Z" for your Region, and go online. You don't have to play (it is recommended to just host a game, or join one), we just need Server Interaction Dumps, and how you Interact with the Game.**
**7. After playing (or not) for only about 30min, you've created a `NEX Dump`. Which is what we need to preserve the game.**
**8. Fork and Upload the Files to the Following Repository on GitHub: "[ISZ-NEX-Dumps](https://github.com/Cracko298/ISZ-NEX-Dumps)".**
**9. If you don't know how to Fork and Create a PR, please Send me a DM with the Dumps you've created. Everyone who helps out will be accredited, or not if you so choose.**

**Again, we need YOUR help, and we Cannot do this without you guys'.**
**Please consider helping out!**
