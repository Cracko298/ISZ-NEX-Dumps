## THE COMMUNITY NEEDS YOU!
- **I know most of you don't care, don't have a Hacked 3DS, etc. However the Servers that keep Ice Station Z up are closing within the next <ins>12 - 24 hours</ins>!**
- **And I need your help to preserve the game's online functionality, that made it unique, from Chatting, to raiding the Cave from Pocky.**
- **Me and another individual as far as I know, are the only people attempting to make NEX Dumps, I have only 4 Dumps as of now (each about 24kb each).**
- **And while we aren't the best community, or even a community now, we need your help!**

**<ins>1.</ins> If you have a jailbroken 3DS Console, and want to help, you need to Download this [HokakuCTR.3gx](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/HokakuCTR/releases/tag/v1.0.3) plugin from GitHub.**

**<ins>2.</ins> Make sure you have the latest Version of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases) with 3GX Plugin Loading.**

**<ins>3.</ins> Paste the contents of `Luma3DSv13.0.2.zip` onto the Root of the SDHC Card, and paste the `HokakuCTR.3gx` Plugin into the following directory below (Create directories as Needed).**
```

**<ins>5.</ins> Open the Rosalina Menu `L + DPad-Down + Select`, and Press the `A` Button on the `Plugin Loader` Option. Make sure the text reads as follows: `Plugin Loader: [Enabled]`.**

**<ins>6.</ins> Startup "Ice Station Z" for your Region, and go online. You don't have to play (it is recommended to just host a game, or join one), we just need Server Interaction Dumps, and how you Interact with the Game.**

**<ins>7.</ins> After playing (or not) for only about 30min, you've created a `NEX Dump`. Which is what we need to preserve the game.**

**<ins>8.</ins> Fork and Upload the Files to the Following Repository on GitHub: "[ISZ-NEX-Dumps](https://github.com/Cracko298/ISZ-NEX-Dumps)".**

**<ins>9.</ins> If you don't know how to Fork and Create a PR, please Send me a DM via Discord (**cr4cko298**) with the Dumps you've created. Everyone who helps out will be accredited, or not if you so choose.**
